#' @title Calculates net reproduction, R0, according to a given set of rates Lx,fx and a fixed
#'  proportion female of births, \code{pfem}.
#' 
#' @description This function is only provided for the examples of \link{DecompContinuous}. 
#' It calculates the sum of the row products of \code{rates} multiplied by \code{pfem}.
#' 
#' @param rates rates needs to be a matrix with two columns, \code{Lx} and \code{Fx}. Here, \code{Lx} 
#' is the survival function integrated within each age interval and with a lifetable radix of 1. \code{Fx} is
#'  the fertility function, calculated as births/ person years of exposure. \code{sr} is the proportion female
#'  of births by each age of mother. \code{Fx} should simply contain zeros in ages with no fertility, OR, all 
#' vectors should be limited to reproductive ages. Place all vectors in a matrix, or specify rates as 
#' \code{cbind(Lx,Fx)} 
#' @param pfem the proportion female of births by each age of mother. Something like .49, .48, or (1/(2.05)).
#'  This can either be specified as a single number, or it may be allowed to vary by age. For the later case, 
#' be sure to specify a value for each age (each row in \code{rates}).
#' 
#' @details The main feature that functions need to have when specified for \code{DecompContinuous()} is 
#' that the rates must fit into a matrix, where presumably each column is a variable and each row is an age,
#'  as in \code{rates}. Really the decomposition function does not care how things are arranged in the 
#' matrix- the components of change matrix that is returned from \code{Decompcontinuous()} will be arranged
#'  in exactly the same way, so as long as you know how to interpret it, and your function can extract what
#'  it needs from the matrix, then it can be specified in any way. For this particular example function, 
#' \code{R0()}, \code{rates} must be specified with a variable in each column.
#' 
#' @return the value of R0 for the given set of rates and proportion female of births.
#' 
#' @note It would also be possible to redefine the function to place \code{pfem} as an additional column 
#' in the rates matrix, which would allow this item to be decomposed too. Here it is specified separately
#'  in order to demonstrate passing on parameters to the function within \code{DecompContinuous()}.
#' 
#' @seealso See Also as \code{\link{R0vec}}, the same function in the form necessary for 
#' \code{\link{DecompContinuousOrig}}
